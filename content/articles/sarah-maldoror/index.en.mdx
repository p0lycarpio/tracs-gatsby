Sarah Ducados, known as Sarah Maldoror, is considered the first black woman to make films in 1960s Africa, although other directors, such as the documentary maker Thérèse Sita-Bella, were contemporary to her. Her best known feature film, Sambizanga (1972), was equally important in the history of Angolan cinema, since the narrative, adapted from a book by the Angolan writer Luandino Vieira, deals with an episode from the struggle for independence from Portuguese colonialism. She started her career in France, where she continues to direct films, working in television and acting in the public sphere in favor of immigration, the black community, and women. A striking characteristic of her films is the dialogue with literature, such as short stories, novels, and poetry, and the arts in general.
